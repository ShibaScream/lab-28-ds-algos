# Data Structures & Algorithms

## Description

*NOTE: Complete your solutions on a whiteboard or on paper first*

Part 1: Write a function that takes in a BST and a value, the function will insert this
value as a new node in the BST.

Part 2: Write a functin that takes in a BST and a value, the function will remove this
value from the tree. Caveats: No additional nodes can be removed from the tree, and the
tree must remain a valid BST after the node is removed. If the value isn't in the BST,
handle it how you see fit and document your implmentation choice.

Include a thorough set of tests for each function
